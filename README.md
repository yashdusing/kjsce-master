# python_blockchain_app

A simple tutorial for developing a blockchain application from scratch in Python.

## What is blockchain? How it is implemented? And how it works?

Please read the [step-by-step implementation tutorial](https://github.com/satwikkansal/python_blockchain_app/blob/master/step_by_step_tutorial.md) to get your answers :)

## Instructions to run

Clone the project,

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/satwikkansal/python_blockchain_app.git
```

Start a blockchain node server,

```sh
$ python node_server.py
```

Run the application,

```sh
$ python run_app.py
```

The application should be up and running at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

2. Requesting the node to mine

3. Resyncing with the chain for updated data

To play around by spinning off multiple custom nodes, use the `add_nodes/` endpoint to register a new node. To update the node with which the application syncs, change `CONNECTED_NODE_ADDRESS` field in the [views.py](https://github.com/satwikkansal/python_blockchain_app/blob/master/app/views.py) file.
